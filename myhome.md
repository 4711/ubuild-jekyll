    headline: It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you
    content: No… but I'd like to be asked! He'll want to use your <strong>yacht</strong>,
      and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Michael! It's called 'taking
      advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life.Guy's a pro. Bad news. Andy Griffith
      turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. I don't understand the question,
      and I won't respond to it. Really? Did nothing cancel? Really? <br><br><strong><em>Did
      nothing cancel? </em></strong><br><br>We just call it a sausage. No… but I'd
      like to be asked! Michael! I care deeply for nature. No, I did not kill Kitty.
      However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because
      I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.

    content: That's why you always leave a note! Say goodbye to these, because it's
      the last time! I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism,
      sometimes a diet is the best defense.No… but I'd like to be asked! I'm a monster.
      I'm a monster. Whoa, this guy's straight? I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Army
      had half a day.I'm half machine. <br>I'm a monster. That's what it said on 'Ask
      Jeeves.' Army had half a day. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets
      you ahead in life.There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. There's
      only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what
      I'm calling you is a television actor. But I bought a yearbook ad from you,
      doesn't that mean anything anymore?Well, what do you expect, mother? Across
      from where? That's why you always leave a note! There's only one man I've ever
      called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is
      a television actor.
